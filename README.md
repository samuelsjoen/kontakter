# Kontakter

Kontakter is a simple application that let's you create, update and remove contacts from your contacts list. You start by creating a user at the register page. Once you've done that and logged in, you have free access to start adding your contacts!

The application is comprised of a reactjs run frontend and a .NET run backend. It stores users contacts in a sqlite database.
